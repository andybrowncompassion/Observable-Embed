# A WordPress plugin for embedding Observable notebooks

## Usage
    [observable-embed notebook='url to notebook.js' cell='optional cell name']

_note: this shortcode may be used multiple times on a page/post. Specified cells share a common runtime/library so they can interact. Also implemented responsive width functionality so cells respond to resizing of their containers. Skip the cell attribute to display the entire notebook (named cells only)_
